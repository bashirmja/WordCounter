One first step is to ask the candidates to execute a test. It would be fantastic if you could do me the favor to solve the following small task in C# and send the result back to me until beginning of next wek. Please tell me also how much time you’ve spent.
 
Write a program (and prove that it works) that: Given a text file, count the occurrence of each unique word in the file.
For example; a file containing the string “Go do that thing that you do so well” should find these counts;
1: Go
2: do
2: that
1: thing
1: you
1: so
1: well
